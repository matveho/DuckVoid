# This is a temporary solution for tracking progress

## Who's doing on what

### Matvey

- Index Header
  - dynamic text
  - menu on hover
  - mobile scaling
- Hexo Templating
  - color schemes
  - prototype content loading to index
  - fonts
  - remove not needed features

I plan to finish the header by Monday, and the templating is mostly figured out, I just need some preferences for the colors and fonts which I lack.

### Denis

- Index Body
  - carousel, or vertical, or both?
    https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/
  - folder replacement (some graphic thing maybe)
- General Design Decisions (Illustrator probably)
  - colors
  - fonts

## TODO

### Short Term

- Index
  - build menu
  - build writings showcase
  - make nice with probably animated, scoll-linked graphic
- Templating
  - Figure out how it works
  - Rewrite index
  - Consolidate site design
- Design
  - Choose some colors
  - Choose some fonts
  - Choose some md rendering preferences

Site will be ready for 'release' when index is has the three aforementioned features, and links to functional articles with a globally implemented style.

### Long Term

For a while the only way to access the articles will be through the 'showcase' on the index.
When everything in the short term list is done, that shall be expanded:
- rewrite /archives page, add search, filtering, and relevant tagging
- add features, seperate from SSG, on a seperate git branch
  - About page
  - browser editable documents
  - other experiments and crap with a backend
  - github linked projects page?
